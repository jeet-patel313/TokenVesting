### Create a Token Vesting Smart contract with the following Role and features:

1.) Add 3 Roles (Advisor, Partnerships, Mentors)
2.) Dynamic TGE (Token Generation Event) for every role. % of Tokens to be released right after vesting
3.) There should be a cliff of some duration added by the admin. No releasing of tokens for a few weeks or a few months.
4.) The Vesting should be a linear vesting approach which means it should release some amounts of tokens every day to be claimed by users based upon the allocations decided by the admin.

Example:
Create a Token Vesting Contract with 5% TGE for Advisors, 0 % TGE for Partnerships and 7% TGE for Mentors with 2 months cliff and 22 months linear vesting for all roles
